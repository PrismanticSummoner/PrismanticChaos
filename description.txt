Chaos rules over all and those who choose to go against it all perish...except

Welcome to the world of Prismantic Chaos in Terraria a world which plagued by its various monsters and chaos with little balance in it. That balance being you...

--- : Come with me, take a seat for this will be a long one...
--- : There can not be light without dark, good without bad, chaos...without peace...a familiar world with more to it however things always felt different.
--- : Oh where are my manners? The names Panehesy or Pane for short. I've been resurrected from my grave with no body yet I share the same mind as you.
Panehesy : Now...where were we? Ah yes! A seemingly normal world yet something feels off. It has been a bit since moon lord was defeated afterall, several players let the cultists do their summoning and then there was quiet...until...you came along.
Panehesy : I don't know what happened exactly but it was first a cry, then the sounds of stars, then silence...then...there was light. I could see things, yet I couldn't move. I saw the guide, I was killing slimes, I was chopping trees...but it wasn't me...
Panehesy : I have just now realized that I was inside the mind and not the body when the guide spoke to you...
